## Methods

### NewBlockDeviceMappingCreated

`func NewBlockDeviceMappingCreated() *BlockDeviceMappingCreated`

NewBlockDeviceMappingCreated instantiates a new BlockDeviceMappingCreated object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewBlockDeviceMappingCreatedWithDefaults

`func NewBlockDeviceMappingCreatedWithDefaults() *BlockDeviceMappingCreated`

NewBlockDeviceMappingCreatedWithDefaults instantiates a new BlockDeviceMappingCreated object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetBsu

`func (o *BlockDeviceMappingCreated) GetBsu() BsuCreated`

GetBsu returns the Bsu field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetBsuOk

`func (o *BlockDeviceMappingCreated) GetBsuOk() (*BsuCreated, bool)`

GetBsuOk returns a tuple with the Bsu field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetBsu

`func (o *BlockDeviceMappingCreated) SetBsu(v BsuCreated)`

SetBsu sets Bsu field to given value.

### HasBsu

`func (o *BlockDeviceMappingCreated) HasBsu() bool`

HasBsu returns a boolean if a field has been set.

### GetDeviceName

`func (o *BlockDeviceMappingCreated) GetDeviceName() string`

GetDeviceName returns the DeviceName field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetDeviceNameOk

`func (o *BlockDeviceMappingCreated) GetDeviceNameOk() (*string, bool)`

GetDeviceNameOk returns a tuple with the DeviceName field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetDeviceName

`func (o *BlockDeviceMappingCreated) SetDeviceName(v string)`

SetDeviceName sets DeviceName field to given value.

### HasDeviceName

`func (o *BlockDeviceMappingCreated) HasDeviceName() bool`

HasDeviceName returns a boolean if a field has been set.
